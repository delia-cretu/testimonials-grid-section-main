## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I used CSS Grid to create the desktop layout and Flexbox for the mobile-responsive layout which helped me gain a better understanding of both.

### Continued development

I struggled using CSS Grid to create the mobile layout which is why I chose to use Flexbox instead. I have more to learn about converting a grid layout into a 1-column layout suitable ofr mobile viewing.
